## About &amp; contact

I'm [Andrew Howe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maverickactuary/), actuary and founder of Transformaction.

Transformaction is a boutique consultancy working with market leaders and challengers, especially in the individual protection market: IFA channel insurers, Friendly Societies and aggregator brands.

I do or oversee all work, exploiting my experience and expertise in pricing, reinsurance and more.

I don't bluff, can be as hands on as you wish and come with CEO level references.
