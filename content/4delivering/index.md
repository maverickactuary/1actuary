# Delivering for you

Here's the stark reality: few big protection projects succeed.

This article reflects 20 years' immersion on the individual protection market: growing a challenger to the second biggest IFA player, launching a two-man virtual life office then working for the impressive force which has been the biggest protection insurer for the last 15 years.

Beyond that I've seen the good, bad and ugly at clients and have been (at least) an observer of launches and relaunches over the last 10 years: Beagle Street, Canada Life, Guardian, HSBC and Scottish Widows &mdash; some of whom have been clients.

This article sets out some of the lessons learned: why do so many big projects struggle and what can we do to improve the chances of success and cut down on wasted?

## My audience

1. **Specialists** who can build and grow beyond Income Protection.
2. **Challengers** who can improve to be a top 6 player.
3. **Leaders** who still have scope for optimizations.

This article is especially aimed at 1 and 2 above: those wanting to build a major protection proposition, robustly, cost effectively and at pace and those who (hopefully) realize that they have significant work to do to catch the leaders &mdash; and may have to do different things.

## Why you need a fresh approach

Successful protection (re-)launches by those not already in the top six come around once a decade. The new approach saves money, heartache and face and provides upside.

**The worst case scenario** under the new approach is to stop after stage 3, with three months' effort and a five-figure spend. Contrast that with pulling a launch after two or more years' work. Worse still, spending tens of millions on systems and consultants with little to show.

That's real risk management.

**The best case scenario** is that you have, under the new approach:

+ a robust business case
+ likely market position and profitability
+ unheard of new entrant protection capability
+ credibility with reinsurers

That's within three months.

This supplies the drive to move forward and spend with confidence.

| #   | Old   | New  |
| :-: | :---- | :--- |
| 1   | Proposition ideas. Talk to a reinsurer | Build an internal case. Test it with an expert. |
| 2   | Product build. More reinsurance chat.  | Build capability: analytics and pricing.        |
| 3   | Systems work. Get reinsurance(?)       | Approach reinsurer. Factor terms into pricing.  |
| 4   | Give up. Or finish build and launch.   | Give up. Or build and launch.                   |
| 5   | Exhaustion or continued struggle.      | Review, reap and improve.                       |

## Five stages to successful launch

### Stage 1

**In the old world** this involved generating the proposition. Perhaps you have a blank sheet of paper, are unconstrained by legacy systems and have great product ideas. You may talk to a reinsurer. They've heard all this before, but are (may be) too polite to say.

**In the new world** you do the above, but instead of approaching reinsurers get the proposition reviewed by a protection expert. He's heard all this before, but is not too polite to say. Instead he builds on your ideas, suggests what reinsurers want and equips you.

### Stage 2

**In the old world** you start the product and (perhaps) systems build. There's more reinsurance chat. It's not entirely clear where this will end, but you are confident you can swing it and you can always run without reinsurance; they'll realize their mistake after launch.

**In the new world** you start the capability build. You need a basis, a tool and a person to set prices. Your expert steps in, adding that reinsurers want distributor level data and analytics. He supplies this too and puts you in contact with experienced underwriting developers.

### Stage 3

**In the old world** you recruit or upgrade your underwriting team or buy in expertise. You start or continue with the systems work, which now includes an underwriting engine. There's significant commitment and the spend is mounting. No sign of reinsurance yet.

**In the new world** your expert introduces you to several reinsurers. They are impressed with your insight. They can certainly work with your expert and nominated underwriters. A few days later two reinsurers confirm that they will supply terms. Three weeks later indicative terms arrive.

**At this point you have a robust business case, including:**

+ indicative reinsurance rates
+ your potential market position on a portal
+ pricing and analytics capability

### Stage 4

**In the old world** you're a year or more in and the build is progressing slowly. You've gone back to the first reinsurer. They now say "no" &mdash; explicitly. But this is no time for turning back.

**In the new world** month four is about to start and you need to decide how you move forward wih pace. Your protection expert suggests that the launch will take at most 9 months: a year from start to finish. You start spending more money, confident in the return.

### Stage 5

**In the old world** you recruit or upgrade your underwriting team or buy in expertise. You start or continue with the systems work, which now includes an underwriting engine. There's significant commitment and the spend is mounting. No sign of reinsurance yet.

**In the new world** you kep the expert on, he introduced you to his underwriting and systems associates. You launched in ten (10) months. You want more of this and are gearing up, delivering on your promises to reinsurers and looking forward to the next stage of growth.

You've already tripled your new business, but your expert says he can get you further growth of 500%+ in two years. What a journey!
